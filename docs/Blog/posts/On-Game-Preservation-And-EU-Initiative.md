# On Games Preservation, and the EU Initiative
*A measured look into Stop Killing Games, it's proposed benefits, and the potential problems it may cause for the industry*

In recent months, a petition has been circulating through the European Union, that has the stated intention of preventing game developers and publishers from "destroying" video games. I have seen a multitude of reactions and arguments concerning the issue, and the most vocal within these arguments take the stance of, what seems to me, blind acceptance and support of this initiative. Unfortunately, as with many disagreements on the internet, this also seems to come with a fair helping of threats and a perpetuation of the "us vs. them" mentality that has plagued society of late.

What is the initiative even asking for, really? What do both sides have as argument or evidence for their stance? Is there any real point to the debate, or am I about to publish a meaningless opinion piece on something that will die before it even reaches the desks of the EU Representatives? I hope to at least shed some light on a few of these questions, at least as far as the initiative itself, and what the discussion surrounding it has been, as well as my thoughts as both a developer and player.

## What is the Initiative?
