# Welcome to the Corvid Tower

I'm glad you found this place. I made this as a web-based form of nexus point
for various things that I'm doing

## About Me 

Hi, I'm known on the internet as Raven Corvonne. I'm an Indie game developer,
musician, artist, and overall absolute dipshit on the internet. I'm currently
studying Cybersecurity at my local college, while also developing a *Mega Man
Battle Network*-inspired game im calling *Deiform*

On this site you'll find a general blog about things ive been doing or thinking
about over the week, a devlog for *Deiform*, as well as links to my Discord,
Twitch, and other social media outlets.

I hope you enjoy the things i do here, I intend to be doing them for a good
long while.
